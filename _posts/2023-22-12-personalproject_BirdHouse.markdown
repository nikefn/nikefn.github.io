## To build a Birdhouse


![Me and my birdhouse](/assets/images/proj-personal/birdhouse/meandmybirdhouse.jpg)Me & My Birdhouse, 2023

In 2023 I found the book *["Vogelhäuser selbst gebaut" by Ramuz, McAllister and Magrill (2001)](https://search.worldcat.org/de/title/76711712)* in a giveaway box in my street and I was fascinated about the crazy designs it features. Look at this one:

However, I opted to go for a more classic design and paint it with bold colours.

In 2023, sadly no tenants moved in. It was only later that I found in a document issued by *[NABU (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union Germany)](https://www.nabu.de/tiere-und-pflanzen/voegel/helfen/nistkaesten/01105.html)* that bright colors should be avoided when painting birdhouses, as birds prefer environments where they can stay hidden and secure with their young. Seems like a reasonable choice! Maybe also the timing of placing the birdhouse outside might not have been ideal - NABU offers advice on this topic as well.

Let's see, maybe I will go for a repaint in 2024 and hoping for better success in attracting tenants.

Crafting the birdhouse from wood proved more challenging than anticipated. Initially, I attempted to saw the wood into the correct shape at home. However, achieving precise and straight edges was difficult.

Consequently, I moved to use the facilities at [Hobbyhimmel](https://hobbyhimmel.de/), a co-working workshop in Stuttgart, where they have a professional band saw. This tool  did the job; allowing me to cut the wood with the precision and accuracy needed for a nice birdhouse.

The size of the entrance hole can determine which species of birds are likely to use the house.

To me, there is a certain magic in the simple act of placing a birdhouse outside and inviting the birds to move in. It feels really incredible for me, that it's possible to hang out a birdhouse and just by simply hanging it out, you may expect birds to find it and to move in (maybe even gratefully).

Last year, I had the opportunity to observe a Sparrow skillfully maneuvering around the edges of the roof at my parents' home who live near a forest. Watching the Sparrow really gave me a feeling of their remarkable adaptability and intelligence - their ability to explore and to make the most of their surroundings to fulfill their needs.

Experiencing this warmed my heart and gave me a sense of my connection to the natural world; to me, it emphasised the interplay between humans and nature, how we coexist and that we share the very same spaces around us.

In this regard also see the articles posted by the [New York Times in 2023](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/science/magpies-birds-nests.html) *(paywall)* and by [The Audubon Society in the same year](https://www.audubon.org/news/apparently-magpies-and-crows-are-using-anti-bird-spikes-make-their-nests) about bird's nests built out of bird-countermeasures and materials thought up to deter birds (see picture below). Reading those articles reinforced my feeling of not only living alongside nature but coexisting together ‚with it and the beauty and joy it brings to me. Also, to me, it emphasises how collaborating with nature can be beneficial rather than obstructive.

*In this sense - fingers crossed for 2024 to have someone move in :)!*

## Positive Energy Districts - Project SPARCS

Synopsis: The [SPARCS][1] project, funded by the European Union, aims to facilitate the transformation of urban areas into sustainable smart cities. It recognizes the role of renewable technologies and the need for a deep understanding of operational complexities, alongside fostering communication among citizens, communities, industries, and authorities.

SPARCs promotes the participation of building blocks and districts in the energy market to help cities become energy producers. With 31 partners from 9 EU countries, the project involves a variety of stakeholders in its efforts to create carbon-free, inclusive communities.

A key aspect of SPARCS, led by Fraunhofer alongside [BABLE][2], is the Work Package on 'Replication'. This focuses on how the progress made in one city can be transferred and replicated in others. The task is complex but highly rewarding. It enables engagement with a wide array of cities, each with its unique background and set of technical partners, facilitating an exchange of ideas and strategies.

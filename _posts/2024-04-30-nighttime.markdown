### My personal Night-Shift: Finding Out about the Importance of a Topic

This year, I had the opportunity to participate in a panel discussion at SXSW on ["The Sustainable Nightlife of the Future"](https://www.nighttime.org/vibelabs-unveiling-at-sxsw-how-can-nightlife-go-towards-greener-future-and-what-role-does-ai-play/) - how exciting![^1]

But besides this exciting opportunity, the fact of being able to go to Austin, meeting interesting people and talking on a panel, over the past years the topic grew closely to my heart. ***I genuinely believe that linking the environmental transition a lot of cities worldwide pursue with culture and nightlife could benefit both worlds drastically. And guess what - I'm not alone!***[^2]

**But let's go step by step - how did this all start?**

Back in the days in 2022, when I started working at [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.morgenstadt.de/de/ueberuns/team.html), I took over a project called the [Nighttime Innovation Network](https://digitalakademie-bw.de/startschuss-innovationsnetzwerk-nachtkultur/) from a former colleague - a series of workshops aimed at resolving conflicts between different interest groups in urban nights. Even my city's first night mayor participated. All was pretty exciting for me!

The workshops (all online due to Covid-aftermath) [followed a consistent structure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NNyccauycP9rLKWHcROoYFiSQzGsh395/view?usp=sharing): Intro done by me, then breakout sessions in different groups, then discussion in big group.

Over time and over multiple workshop sessions together we went through identifying overarching themes and subtopics to related challenges and possible solutions[^3]. This process yielded a long list of possible ways forward, from which we compiled a more general and concise version of policy recommendations. I could present the findings at the [about pop conference](https://www.aboutpop.de/) conference on night-culture and we received positive feedback[^4].

However, one thing stayed with me—during all discussions, it was challenging to keep myself and everyone else *'on track'*. We were constantly tempted to switch between *different layers* of the problem — from e.g. an *individual* dispute at a specific time and place in the night, to the *'bigger picture'*, and *individual* participants' recommendations on best practices and *personal* experiences. Nevertheless, we managed and the outcome was useful and well-received. *This experience got very important in thinking up our new concepts with vibelab and the others.*

The project finished, and sadly, no follow-up funding was secured, so in my working days the [Nighttime Innovation Network](https://digitalakademie-bw.de/startschuss-innovationsnetzwerk-nachtkultur/) was naturally replaced with other projects. But it continued to ruminate inside me, and I began reading mostly on nocturnal [insects](https://www.science.org/content/article/where-have-all-insects-gone) and their [relationship to light](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44785-3) [^5] and found the book *Managing Cities at Night: A Practitioner Guide*[^6].

**A nocturnal Aha-Moment**

It wasn't until 2023 that I was invited to speak on a panel titled ['The Night - The Forgotten Time in City Development'](https://noek-conference.com/) NOEK Conference in Mannheim[^7]. Just by reading the title, it clicked, and I saw what I did not see before: All the projects I was involved with at Fraunhofer dealt with cities, and all the frameworks and initiatives within them, yet none touched on the topic of the night.

My thought process went something like this:

- Aha, day and night are roughly equal in duration, yet our projects primarily focus on daytime.[^8]
- Hm, but we had the Innovation Network that happened for the night. But wait, funding just ran out and everybody went their way. Inside my other projects we are not covering the topic.... *(for a disclaimer see footnote)*[^9]
- ***All the discussions I had with colleagues and friends on the topic came back to me, wow!***

In the aftermath of this conference I intensified my reading with the publications by [Kevin J. Gaston's](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=np4zMp8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), [Vibelab's](https://vibe-lab.org/#meettheteam) and [Jordi Nofre's](https://novaresearch.unl.pt/en/persons/jordi-nofre) texts.

***And then - it was all magic*** - [I got invited to SXSW](https://www.nighttime.org/vibelabs-unveiling-at-sxsw-how-can-nightlife-go-towards-greener-future-and-what-role-does-ai-play/), met many like-minded people, and experienced many new 'click' moments. One statement from the panel by Lutz resonated with me — that due to rising temperatures, urban life will likely shift towards the evening and night, making the topic ever more crucial to address. Well - how more important can it all get?!


*As this blog post is getting a bit lengthy, let me continue with the concepts we came up with in the next one :) - Thanks for reading. btw - this is my first blogpost, yay :)*

And to [The German Center for Research and Innovation New York](https://www.dwih-newyork.org/en/event/vibelab-sxsw-2024/) for the financial support.

[^2]: First and foremost Lutz from Vibelab. As well big thank you to [Jordi Nofre](https://novaresearch.unl.pt/en/persons/jordi-nofre) for picking up the phone and for talking. [Jordi's research](https://scholar.google.es/citations?hl=en&user=CMtTJQsAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) helped me a lot in understanding the topic better. Also [Kevin J. Gaston's work](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=np4zMp8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) helped me so much.

[^8]: *Writing this makes me feel kinda silly - this is all so obvious, right?*

[^9]: *Disclaimer: After a critical note from a friend, please note: This is simplified and reflecting my personal journey. I am trying to target the bigger picture with my argument and do not want to discredit initiatives that already move in this bridging both worlds. What I personally observed is that topics related to sustainability are often approached from the cultural/societal sphere's vision and concept, not as someone from the ecological or city-development sphere might frame them. This goes vice-versa.*

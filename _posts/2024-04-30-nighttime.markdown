### My personal Night-Shift: Finding Out about the Importance of a Topic

This year, I had the opportunity to participate in a panel discussion at SXSW on "The Sustainable Nightlife of the Future" - how exciting!

Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference.

But besides this exciting opportunity, the fact of being able to go to Austin, meeting interesting people and talking on a panel, over the past years the topic grew closely to my heart. I genuinely believe that linking the environmental transition a lot of cities worldwide pursue with culture and nightlife could benefit both worlds drastically. And guess what - I'm not alone [see]!

**But let's go step by step - how did this all start?**

Back in the days in 2022, when I started working at Fraunhofer IAO, I took over a project called the Nighttime Innovation Network from a former colleague. The Nighttime Innovation Network—a series of workshops aimed at resolving conflicts between different 'interest groups' in urban nights. Even my city's first night mayor participated. All was pretty exciting for me!

The workshops (all online due to Covid-aftermath) followed a consistent structure: Intro done by me, then breakout sessions in different groups, then discussion in big group. Over time and over multiple workshop sessions we went from large to small and then to large again. Meaning first overarching themes and subtopics were identified, then challenges and possible solutions to those subtopics and then (going large again). This process yielded a long list of possible ways forward, from which we compiled a more general and concise version of policy recommendations. It all sounds straightforward. I could present the findings at a conference on night-culture and overall, we received positive feedback.

However, one thing stayed with me—during all discussions, it was challenging to keep myself and everyone else 'on track'. We were constantly tempted to switch between different layers of the problem—from an individual dispute at a specific time and place in the night, to the 'bigger picture', and individual participants' recommendations on best practices and personal experiences. Nevertheless, the outcome was useful and well-received.

The project finished, and sadly, no follow-up funding was secured, so it was naturally replaced with other projects. But it continued to ruminate within me, and I began to focus mostly on nocturnal insects and their relationship to light [cite Nature] and the book [cite management of the night book].

**A Nocturnal Aha-Moment**

It wasn't until 2023 that I was invited to speak on a panel titled 'The Night - The Forgotten Time in City Development' at the NOEK conference [Link to Noek-conference]. Just by reading the title, it clicked, and I saw what I hadn't seen before—all the projects I was involved with at Fraunhofer dealt with cities, all the frameworks and initiatives within them, yet none touched on the topic of the night.

I vividly remember this panel discussion as many things became clearer to me. Those connections also gave me hints on how to possibly navigate out of the challenging discussions mentioned earlier. My thought process went something like this:

- Aha, day and night are roughly equal in duration, yet our projects primarily focus on daytime.
- Hm, but we had the Innovation Network that happened for the night. But wait, funding just ran out and everybody went their way. Inside my other projects we are not covering the topic....

*(Disclaimer: After a critical note from a friend, please note: This is simplified and reflecting my personal journey. I am trying to target the bigger picture with my argument and do not want to discredit initiatives that already move in this bridging both worlds. What I personally observed is that topics related to sustainability are often approached from the cultural/societal sphere's vision and concept, not as someone from the ecological or city-development sphere might frame them. This goes vice-versa.)*

**Morgenstadt Twilight Innovations - Moving forward and trying to find a way**

In the aftermath of this conference I intensified my reading. Afterwards, it was all magic — I got invited to SXSW, met many like-minded people, and experienced many new 'click' moments. One statement from the panel by Lutz resonated with me — that due to rising temperatures, urban life will likely shift towards the evening and night, making the topic ever more crucial. Well - how more important can it all get?!

As this blog post is getting a bit lengthy, let me continue with the concept in the next one :) - Thanks for reading.

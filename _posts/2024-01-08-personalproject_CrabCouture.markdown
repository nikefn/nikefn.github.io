## Crab Couture

Since a while I worked with a couple of friends on a new brand idea: The Crab Couture Fashion Label.

It all started out with messing with somewhat funny puns related to crabs and sealife. In this context: Do you know about punpedia? A  website gathering puns on all kinds of topics. And guess what, they have a sea-life edition: [Punpedia Ocean Puns List](https://punpedia.org/ocean-puns/),

We want to think of our brand as sustainable, social start-up, giving away its revenue to sea-protection NGOs and to cancer research; this idea goes by our slogan "Love Crabs, Hate Cancer".

Since the great advancements in generative AI and the Dall:e integration into ChatGPT, I was able to come up with funny and nice looking graphics for our planned t-shirts and garments through the prompts I type. The generated images give me a somewhat bad feeeling in the stomach as they are based on true and unique graphical works done by humans. With the OpenAI plus subscription you get access to their cumulated work without paying nor attributing the individual artist behind the design - and where would we be without those creative people?

Still, let me share what Dall:e, ChatGPT and I came up with. I may gladly share all prompts and details on how I got those with anyone interested. Just reach out.

I tried printing some of the designs and pressed them on a t-shirt in our local co-working workshop [Hobbyhimmel](https://hobbyhimmel.de/). THe workshop is run by volunteers and based off donations. It was a really nice experience and possibilities for diy projects and crafting are endless.

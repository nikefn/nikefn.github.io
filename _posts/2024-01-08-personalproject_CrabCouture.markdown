## Crab Couture

Since a while I worked with a couple of friends on a new brand idea: The Crab Couture Fashion Label.

It all started out with messing with somewhat funny puns related to crabs and sealife. In this context: Do you know about punpedia? A  website gathering puns on all kinds of topics. And guess what, they have a sea-life edition: [Punpedia Ocean Puns List](https://punpedia.org/ocean-puns/),

We want to think of our brand as sustainable, social start-up, giving away its revenue to sea-protection NGOs and to cancer research; this idea goes by our slogan "Love Crabs, Hate Cancer".

Since the great advancements in generative AI and the Dall:e integration into ChatGPT, I was able to come up with funny and nice looking graphics for our planned t-shirts and garments through the prompts I type. The generated images give me a somewhat bad feeeling as the model was trained on time-consuming, genuine and unique graphical works done by humans. With the OpenAI plus subscription you get access to their cumulated work without paying nor attributing the individual artist behind the design - and where would we be without those creative people?

Still, let me share what Dall:e, ChatGPT and I came up with. I may gladly share all prompts and details on how I got those with anyone interested. Just reach out. Text was partly added with Gimp&Inkscape.

You may find a [Brand Identity Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sBh8_KVx-moWjLMZYwgG7HW_GMa3X2SWPLvVgWHNhxE/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Docs. An account on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/crabcoutureofficial) is underway.

I tried printing some of the designs and pressed them on a t-shirt in our local co-working workshop [Hobbyhimmel](https://hobbyhimmel.de/). THe workshop is run by volunteers and based off donations. It was a really nice experience and possibilities for diy projects and crafting are endless.

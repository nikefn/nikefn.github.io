## Dissertation Proposal: *"Urban Narratives and Numerical Goals - Redefining Metrics for Urban Development"*

I am currently developing the exposé for my upcoming dissertation at [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) and the [Department of Urban Systems Engineering](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/de/forschung/forschungsbereiche/stadtsystem-gestaltung.html), titled *"Urban Narratives and Numerical Goals - Redefining Metrics for Urban Development."*

As the title suggests, my research aims to explore the metrics used to assess and guide urban systems, with a particular focus on the interaction between quantitative or *numerical* metrics and qualitative metrics rooted in *narrative* data.

In the management of complex human systems, such as cities, economic metrics often dominate decision-making processes. However, these metrics frequently fall short in sectors where economic gains are not the primary focus; such as culture, urban nature, and most sustainability-related subjects. This gap has long been recognised, as seen in discussions around concepts like the 'Tragedy of the Commons'[^1]. To address this, recent decades have witnessed the development of alternative, often complex, metrics aimed at capturing the value of these overlooked sectors[^2][^3].

The logic behind this approach seems clear: If economics drives our current socioeconomic system, then anything that traditional economic metrics struggle to quantify should be made to fit within that framework, even if this requires increasing complexity in the indicators used. This approach seeks to provide decision-makers with a comprehensive overview, much like the GDP concept, which presents a seemingly neutral number[^4].

As a result, one can not only observe a growing complexity in these indicators but also an increasing number of them, each attempting to provide the right answer and ensure that overlooked sectors receive the importance they deserve in decision-making[^5]. My colleague from the [SPARCS project](https://nikefn.github.io//sparcs), Aapo Huovila, analysed an incredible number of 1,500 *smart and sustainable* city indicators in his dissertation to understand how they contribute to sustainable urban development[^7].

But despite this significant expansion of these alternative metrics, the anticipated *transition to sustainability* remains intangible and slow-moving[^6].

## My Journey Towards Understanding Qualitative Research

While learning about and working with quantitative and qualitative methods, I gradually began to realise the limitations of relying solely on numerical approaches. This understanding didn’t come all at once but developed gradually over the years at university and through my work in academia. During this time, I slowly grew to appreciate the value of qualitative research.

As I reflected on this journey, I recognised how much it has shaped my current research interests, gradually helping me narrow down the scope of my dissertation and better define the research question. It’s only in the past year, after much thought and exploration, that I’ve begun to gain a clearer sense of direction for my dissertation. Ultimately, my goal is to explore ways to give greater emphasis to topics that benefit urban society as a whole, such as urban nature, culture and knowledge, rather than focussing predominantely on monetary considerations in urban development.

When I started my Bachelor’s degree in [Renewable Resources and Bioenergy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en) at the [University of Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en), I was very focused on numbers and facts. My studies in natural sciences — biology, chemistry and the like — reinforced this view. I believed that data and calculations were the most reliable ways to understand and solve the world's problems. This belief was strengthened during my time as a student assistant at the [Life-Cycle Engineering Department GaBi](https://www.iabp.uni-stuttgart.de/gabi/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), where I could take a glimpse into Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) models. These models were complex and detailed, and I found them fascinating.

However, as I worked more with LCAs, I started noticing some things that didn’t make much sense to me. For instance, the that per [LCA study result, disposable plastic bags are better for the environment than reusable cotton ones](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/grocery-bag-environmental-impact). This puzzled me and made me begin to question whether numbers and data could always be trusted to give the full picture - clearly continuing with single-use plastic bags is not the way to go.

A key moment in my journey was during my stay abroad in Clermont-Ferrand, France, where I studied in the class *['Ingéniérie de Dévéloppement Territorial'](https://www.vetagro-sup.fr/formations/ingenieur-agronome/deroulement-des-etudes/)*. This experience involved working closely with towns and cities, using methods like expert interviews and group discussions and e.g. SWOT Analysis and scenario planning. While I didn’t fully appreciate it at the time, this was my first real exposure to qualitative research. It started to open my eyes to the value of approaches that go beyond numbers.

When I returned to Germany to start my [Master’s in Bioeconomy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en/organisation/programme/course/m-bioeconomy) at Hohenheim, I also worked as a student assistant at the [Chair of Environmental Management](hhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140802085139/https://umho.uni-hohenheim.de/). This was when I began to see how different methods — both qualitative and quantitative — could be used together and blend in with economics. I took more courses in social science research, and my interest in these methods steadily grew.

The real change in my thinking came when I joined [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) to work on the [UNaLab Project](https://unalab.eu/) (Urban Nature Labs, H2020 EU project on Nature-Based Solutions). For my Master’s thesis on ["The Governance of Nature-Based Solutions"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3JRqgkWuD8HYwW8yis7Ijm3_PYSOx-e/view?usp=drive_link), I used qualitative methods like expert interviews and grounded theory. This experience was eye-opening for me. I began to understand how these methods could reveal insights that numbers alone couldn’t provide. I was very pleased to receive a top grade for my thesis, which encouraged me to continue exploring this approach.

After completing my Master’s, I joined the [Chair of Societal Transition and Agriculture](https://sta.uni-hohenheim.de/en/) at Hohenheim, where I attended a weekly PhD colloquium. Listening to other students discuss their research, I learned more about the different contexts in which qualitative methods could be used. This deepened my appreciation for these approaches. I also took part in our Chair's journal club and started teaching seminars to Bachelor’s students, where I shared what I had learned.

Again another turning point for me was attending the [ALTER-Net Summer School](https://www.alter-net.info/summer-school/). There, I saw a clear divide between those researchers who relied on quantitative data and those who used qualitative methods. It made me realise that while numbers are often easier to grasp, qualitative research offers a depth of understanding that is just as important, even if it is sometimes harder to apply to broader contexts.

Over time, I’ve come to understand that both qualitative and quantitative methods have their own strengths and limitations. The challenge, I believe, lies in finding ways to use them together effectively.

Looking back, I see how much my thinking has changed. I started out doubting the value of qualitative research, but now I recognise it as essential for understanding complex issues. My experiences have led me to a research question that I care deeply about: How can we ensure that crucial topics like culture, nature, and knowledge are not overlooked but are given the recognition they deserve?

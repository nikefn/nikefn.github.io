I am currently developing the exposé for my upcoming dissertation at [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) and the [Department of Urban Systems Engineering](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/de/forschung/forschungsbereiche/stadtsystem-gestaltung.html), titled *"Urban Narratives and Numerical Goals - Redefining Metrics for Urban Development."*

As the name implies, in my research I want to focus on the metrics and indicators used to evaluate and guide urban systems, with an emphasis on how quantitative (or *numerical*) metrics interact with qualitative (or *narrative*) data.

Managing complex human systems like cities often revolves around economic metrics, which heavily influence decision-making. However, these economic measures often fall short in areas where financial profit is not the primary objective, such as in culture, urban nature and in most sustainability-related topics ([see e.g. here](https://nikefn.github.io//nighttime2/))[^8]. This gap has been recognised for quite some time, as demonstrated e.g. in debates about concepts like the 'Tragedy of the Commons'[^1]. To address this, alternative metrics and indicators have been developed in recent decades to better account for the value of these often neglected sectors[^2] [^3] [^5].

The idea behind these alternative approaches is to provide decision-makers with seemingly neutral figures or charts, easy to overlook and similar to traditional economic metrics, but designed to include previously overlooked areas[^4]. It makes sense: If our current socio-economic system is largely driven by economic metrics, then we need to find ways to fit important aspects like culture, nature or human well-being into that framework. There is broad consensus on the significance of these sectors and the need to include them in decision-making (e.g. the [UN Declaration on SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)[^9]).

However, the difficulty lies in developing these alternative metrics without making things overly complex. This seems paradoxical as the main reason for creating a single figure to represent a sector’s status in city development is to make things easier to grasp. Yet, the world *is* inherently complex, with its diverse cities, administrations, populations and site-specificities. As a result, one can observe a growing number of metrics designed to fit specific questions or locations. Ans not only has the number of these metrics increased, but their complexity has grown as well, as they try to capture many real-world conditions that are difficult to quantify. This makes it challenging to know which metrics or indicators to use in specific cases, how to apply them properly and to understand their limitations. My colleague from the [SPARCS project](https://nikefn.github.io//sparcs), Aapo Huovila, examined an impressive collection of 1,500 *smart and sustainable* city indicators in his dissertation ['Evaluation of Smart and Sustainable City Development: What Indicators to Use, Why and When?'](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/publications/evaluation-of-smart-and-sustainable-city-development-what-indicat) to assess their contribution to sustainable urban development[^7].

***Yet, despite all this progress in developing alternative indicators and metrics, the long-awaited shift towards sustainability at scale remains elusive[^6].***

This brings me to my central question: What can we learn from this approach? And are there alternative pathways that might be more effective?

My interest in this topic didn’t develop overnight. It has taken time and I’d like to share how my thoughts have evolved…

## My Journey Towards Understanding Qualitative Research

In the past, I worked with both quantitative and qualitative methods, but over time I began to see the limitations of relying only on numbers. This realisation didn’t come overnight; it took me quite some time to understand where and how qualitative research excels. Only slowly, I came to fully appreciate the value that qualitative research brings.

When I reflect on my journey, I realise that this subject had been on my mind for quite a while, though I wasn’t always able to express it clearly. Over the last year, after much thought and exploration, I’ve developed a clearer sense of the direction I want to take. My interest and my aim is to find ways to give greater emphasis to areas like urban nature, culture, and knowledge in urban development, rather than focusing only on economic factors as bottom-line for decision-making.

When I started my Bachelor’s in [Renewable Resources and Bioenergy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en) at the [University of Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en), I was very much focused on numbers and facts. The natural sciences — biology, chemistry, and the like — reinforced this way of thinking. I believed that data, calculations and statistics were the most reliable way to understand the world’s issues. This belief was strenghtened during my time as a student assistant at the [Life-Cycle Engineering Department GaBi](https://www.iabp.uni-stuttgart.de/gabi/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), where I got a glimpse into Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) models of materials, products, and services. These models were highly detailed and well thought out, which fascinated me.

However, as I worked more with LCAs, I began to notice some things that didn’t sit right with me. For instance, one [LCA study found that single-use plastic bags have a lower environmental impact per use than reusable cotton bags](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/grocery-bag-environmental-impact) in certain categories[^a]. The study suggested that reusable cotton bags would need to be used thousands of times to offset their higher impact in these categories. Although the findings were likely valid within the scope of the study, the conclusions seemed counterintuitive, especially given the widespread environmental problems caused by plastic pollution. Just think of the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch). Similarly, some LCA comparisons between organic and conventional farming showed that organic agriculture, despite its many social and environmental benefits, might require more land and resources due to lower yields. This could lead to less favourable outcomes in LCA scores and overall 'sustainability' rankings[^c]. Based on my experience working on a Demeter-certified organic farm, this didn’t seem to add up. It felt like something was missing.

A key experience in my journey came during my time studying in Clermont-Ferrand in France in the programme *['Ingéniérie de Dévéloppement Territorial'](https://www.vetagro-sup.fr/formations/ingenieur-agronome/deroulement-des-etudes/)*. The class involved working closely with towns and cities, using methods like expert interviews, group discussions, SWOT analysis and scenario planning. Applying those methods in a real-world context, in another country and setting; struggling with the language and understanding; having to re-read everything multiple times and asking countless and endless questions; helped me a lot in gaining a deeper appreciation for qualitative methods and their value beyond just numbers.

I eventually finished my Bachelor's and then began my [Master’s in Bioeconomy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en/organisation/programme/course/m-bioeconomy) at Hohenheim. During this time, I started working as a student assistant at the [Chair of Environmental Management](hhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140802085139/https://umho.uni-hohenheim.de/). Environmental Management involves finding ways to balance environmental protection with economic and social development, which really resonated with me. This role gave me hands-on experience in seeing how sustainability challenges could be tackled from multiple angles and it helped me see how qualitative and quantitative methods could work together.




When I joined [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) to work in the [UNaLab Project](https://unalab.eu/) (Urban Nature Labs, a Horizon 2020 EU project on Nature-Based Solutions), my appreciation for qualitative methods continued to grow. For my Master’s thesis on ["The Governance of Nature-Based Solutions"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3JRqgkWuD8HYwW8yis7Ijm3_PYSOx-e/view?usp=drive_link), I used qualitative methods such as expert interviews and grounded theory to better understand governance in urban re-greening. This experience helped me see how much can be uncovered through qualitative approaches, going beyond what numbers can show.  I was highly encouraged by the feedback (and by receiving the best grade hehe). It reassured me that this was a path worth pursuing further.


After completing my Master’s, I joined the [Chair of Societal Transition and Agriculture](https://sta.uni-hohenheim.de/en/) at Hohenheim, where I regularly attended a PhD colloquium. Listening to other students present their research and how they combine and apply both quantitative and qualitative methods in diverse contexts around the world helped me better understand the variety of contexts in which qualitative methods could be applied. This deepened my appreciation for these approaches. I also participated in the Chair’s journal club and began teaching seminars to Bachelor’s students, sharing what I had learned.

Another turning point came when I attended the [ALTER-Net Summer School](https://www.alter-net.info/summer-school/). There, I observed a clear divide between researchers who relied on quantitative data and those who used qualitative methods. This made me realise that while numbers can often be more straightforward, qualitative research offers a depth of understanding that is just as essential, even though it can be more challenging to apply in broader contexts.

Over time, I’ve come to see that both quantitative and qualitative methods have their own strengths and limitations. The challenge, as I see it, is finding effective ways to combine them.

Looking back, I see how much my thinking has changed. Early on, I was convinced that statistics and numbers-based approaches were the only reliable way to uncover truth, provide fundamental insights and guide evidence-based decision-making. However, over time, I’ve come to recognise the essential role that qualitative research plays in addressing complex issues. My experiences have shaped a research question that I now feel deeply passionate about: How can we further strengthen important topics like culture, nature and knowledge in city development? And how can we make sure that they are not overshadowed by economics and e given the attention they deserve in decision-making processes?

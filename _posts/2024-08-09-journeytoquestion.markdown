### Dissertation Proposal: *"Urban Narratives and Numerical Goals - Redefining Metrics for Urban Development"*

I am currently developing the proposal for my upcoming dissertation at [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) and the [Department of Urban Systems Engineering](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/de/forschung/forschungsbereiche/stadtsystem-gestaltung.html), titled *"Urban Narratives and Numerical Goals - Redefining Metrics for Urban Development"*.

As the title suggests, my research idea focuses on the metrics and indicators used to evaluate and guide urban systems, with an emphasis on how quantitative (or *numerical*) metrics interact with qualitative (or *narrative*) data.

Managing complex human systems like cities often turns around economic metrics, which heavily influence decision-making. However, these economic measures frequently fall short in areas where financial profit is not the primary objective, such as culture, urban nature and most sustainability-related topics. This fundamental gap of economic theory has been recognised for quite some time [^10]. The discussions around it gave birth to new scientific fields like environmental economics and new concepts like the 'Tragedy of the Commons'.[^1]

To address this gap, alternative metrics and indicators have been developed in recent decades to better account for the value of these often neglected sectors.[^2][^3][^4] The idea behind these alternative approaches is to provide decision-makers with seemingly neutral figures or charts, similar to traditional economic metrics but designed to include the previously overlooked areas.

There is broad consensus on the significance of these sectors and the need to include them in decision-making, see e.g. the internationally ratified [United Nations' Declaration on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals).[^5]

However, the difficulty lies in developing these alternative metrics without making things overly complex. This seems paradoxical because the main reason for creating a single figure to represent a sector's status in city development is to make it easier to grasp. Yet, the world *is* inherently complex, with its diverse cities, administrations, people and site-specific characteristics. As a result, there is a growing number of metrics designed to fit specific questions or locations. Not only has the number of these metrics increased, but their complexity has grown as they try to capture many real-world conditions that are difficult to quantify. This makes it challenging to know which metrics or indicators to use in specific cases, how to apply them properly and to understand their limitations.

An impressive testimony of this development is the excellent dissertation of my colleague from the [SPARCS project](https://nikefn.github.io//sparcs), Aapo Huovila. Aapo examined an impressive collection of **1,500 smart and sustainable city indicators** in his dissertation [*"Evaluation of Smart and Sustainable City Development: What Indicators Matter?"*](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/publications/evaluation-of-smart-and-sustainable-city-development-what-indicat)[^6].

> **Yet, despite all this progress in developing alternative indicators and metrics, the long-awaited shift towards sustainability at scale remains elusive.**[^7]

This brings me to my central question: What can we learn from this development and are there alternative pathways that might offer more insights?

... My interest in this topic did not develop overnight. It has taken time and I would like to share how my thoughts have evolved...

### My Journey Towards Understanding Qualitative Research

In the past, I worked with both quantitative and qualitative methods, but over time I began to see the limitations of relying solely on numbers. This realisation did not come immediately; it took time for me to fully appreciate the value of qualitative research.

While reflecting, I realised that this subject had been on my mind for quite a while, though I was not always able to express it clearly. Over the last year, after much thought and exploration, I could develop a clearer sense of the direction I want to take in my dissertation. Ultimately, my aim is to find ways to give greater emphasis to areas like urban nature, culture, knowledge and *qualitative* factors in urban development that are usually hard to measure. Of course rather than focusing only on economic factors as the bottom line for decision-making.

#### Educational Background and Early Experiences

When I started my Bachelor's in [Renewable Resources and Bioenergy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en) at the [University of Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en), I was very much focused on numbers and facts. The natural sciences - biology, chemistry and the like - reinforced this way of thinking. I believed that data, calculations and statistics were the most reliable ways to understand the world's questions. This belief was strengthened during my time as a student assistant at the [Life-Cycle Engineering Department GaBi](https://www.iabp.uni-stuttgart.de/gabi/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), where I got a glimpse into Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) models of materials, products and services. LCAs are comprehensive methods for evaluating the environmental impacts associated with all stages of a product's life. These models were highly detailed and well thought out, which fascinated me.

However, as I worked more with LCAs, I began to notice some things that did not sit right with me. For instance, some LCA comparisons between organic and conventional farming showed that organic agriculture, despite its many social and environmental benefits, might require more land and resources due to lower yields. This could lead to less favourable outcomes in LCA scores and overall 'sustainability' rankings.[^8] Based on my experience working on a Demeter-certified organic farm - a form of biodynamic agriculture with strict standards for ecological and social responsibility - this did not seem to add up. It felt like something was missing.

Similarly, one [LCA study found that single-use plastic bags have a lower environmental impact per use than reusable cotton bags](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/grocery-bag-environmental-impact) in certain categories. The study suggested that reusable cotton bags would need to be used thousands of times to offset their higher impact in these categories.[^9] Although the findings are likely valid within the scope of the study, the conclusions one may draw from it seemed counterintuitive - should we, in the short run, use no bags at all and continue with plastic bags until the production of cotton ones is more environmentally friendly? Especially given the obvious widespread environmental problems caused by plastic pollution, such as the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch).

Moreover, LCAs dealing with ex-post analysis about products and services and future predictions become less reliable due to the growing influence of assumptions on the results. Yet, they provide exact numbers that suggest certainty.

#### Exposure to Qualitative Methods in Practice

A key experience in my journey came during my time studying in Clermont-Ferrand in France in the programme [*Ingénierie du Développement Territorial*](https://www.vetagro-sup.fr/formations/ingenieur-agronome/deroulement-des-etudes/). The class involved working closely with towns and cities, using methods like expert interviews, group discussions, SWOT analysis and scenario planning. Applying these methods in a real-world context, in another country and setting; struggling with the language and understanding; having to re-read everything multiple times and asking countless questions - all of this helped me gain a deeper appreciation for qualitative methods and their value beyond numbers.

I eventually completed my Bachelor's and then began my [Master's in Bioeconomy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en/organisation/programme/course/m-bioeconomy) at Hohenheim. During this time, I started working as a student assistant at the [Chair of Environmental Management](https://web.archive.org/web/20140802085139/https://umho.uni-hohenheim.de/). Environmental Management involves finding ways to balance environmental protection with economic and social development, which resonated with me. This role gave me hands-on experience in seeing how sustainability challenges could be tackled from multiple angles and helped me see how qualitative and quantitative methods could work together.

When I joined the [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) as a student assistant to work in the [UNaLab Project](https://unalab.eu/) (Urban Nature Labs, a Horizon 2020 EU project on Nature-Based Solutions), my appreciation for qualitative methods continued to grow. For my Master's thesis on [*"The Governance of Nature-Based Solutions"*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3JRqgkWuD8HYwW8yis7Ijm3_PYSOx-e/view?usp=drive_link), I used qualitative methods such as expert interviews and grounded theory to better understand governance in urban re-greening. This experience helped me see how much can be uncovered through qualitative approaches, going beyond what numbers can show. I was highly encouraged by the positive feedback I received, which reassured me that this was a path worth pursuing further.

After completing my Master's, I joined the [Chair of Societal Transition and Agriculture](https://sta.uni-hohenheim.de/en/) at Hohenheim, where I regularly attended a PhD colloquium. Listening to other students present their research and how they combine and apply both quantitative and qualitative methods in diverse contexts around the world helped me better understand the variety of contexts in which qualitative methods could be applied. I also participated in the Chair's journal club and began teaching seminars to Bachelor's students, sharing what I had learned.

Another turning point came when I attended the [ALTER-Net Summer School](https://www.alter-net.info/summer-school/). There, I observed a clear divide between researchers who relied on quantitative data and those who used qualitative methods. This experience highlighted the need for a balanced approach that leverages the strengths of both methodologies.

#### Balancing Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches

Growing up in an education system based on the natural sciences that emphasised logical reasoning and empirical methods, I found it easier to follow and grasp straightforward calculations than detailed reasonings with methods of social science. Yet, this made me realise that while numbers can often be more straightforward, qualitative research offers a depth of understanding that is just as essential, even though it can be more challenging to apply in broader contexts.

Over time, I have come to see that both quantitative and qualitative methods have their own strengths and limitations. Integrating both approaches can offer a more comprehensive understanding of complex issues like urban development. My experiences have shaped a research question that I now feel deeply passionate about: How can we further strengthen important topics that are hard to quantify. Like culture, nature and knowledge in city development? And how can we ensure that they are not overshadowed by economics and given the attention they deserve in decision-making processes?

I am currently developing the exposé for my upcoming dissertation at [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) and the [Department of Urban Systems Engineering](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/de/forschung/forschungsbereiche/stadtsystem-gestaltung.html), titled *"Urban Narratives and Numerical Goals - Redefining Metrics for Urban Development."*

As the title suggests, my research aims to explore the metrics and indicators used to assess and guide urban systems, with a particular focus on the interaction between quantitative or *numerical* metrics and qualitative indicators rooted in *narrative* data.

In the management of complex human systems, such as cities, economic metrics often dominate decision-making processes. However, these metrics frequently fall short in sectors where economic gains are not the primary target; such as culture, urban nature and most sustainability-related subjects ([see e.g. here](https://nikefn.github.io//nighttime2/))[^8]. This gap has long been recognised, as seen in discussions around concepts like the 'Tragedy of the Commons'[^1]. To address this, recent decades have witnessed the development of alternative metrics and indicators aimed at capturing the value of these overlooked sectors[^2] [^3] [^5].

This approach tries to give decision-makers seemingly neutral numbers or charts, much like traditional economic metrics, but specifically designed to include previously overlooked sectors[^4]. The logic behind this approach seems clear: If economics drive our current socioeconomic system, anything that traditional economic metrics struggle to quantify — such as culture, nature, or human well-being — needs to be adapted to fit within the established monetary framework. There is a wide agreement on the importance of these sectors and the importance of taking them into account in decision-making (e.g. see the [UN Declaration on SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)[^9].

The challenge lies in developing these alternative metrics without excessively increasing complexity. Given the complexities of the world — including site-specific characteristics and differences between cities, administrations and people — an ever-growing number of metrics has emerged in an attempt to address these questions in the right form, for the right question at a given location. And not only has the number of alternative metrics increased, but but also their complexity as more aspects of real-world conditions are taken into account to address the above mentioned sectors. This makes it difficult to keep track of the different available approaches, to understand which metrics and indicators to use when, how to correctly apply them and where possible pitfalls might lie. My colleague from the [SPARCS project](https://nikefn.github.io//sparcs), Aapo Huovila, analysed an incredible number of 1,500 *smart and sustainable* city indicators in his dissertation [Evaluation of Smart and Sustainable City Development: What Indicators to Use, Why and When?](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/publications/evaluation-of-smart-and-sustainable-city-development-what-indicat) to understand how they contribute to sustainable urban development[^7].

And here's the thing: Despite this significant expansion of these alternative indicators and metrics, the anticipated transition to sustainability remains intangible and slow-moving[^6].

## My Journey Towards Understanding Qualitative Research

While working with both quantitative and qualitative methods, I gradually began to realise the limitations of relying solely on numerical approaches. This understanding did not come immediately but developed over the years during my university studies and work in academia. During this period, I slowly grew to appreciate the value of qualitative research.

As I reflected on this journey, I recognised how much it has shaped my current research interests, gradually helping me narrow down the scope of my dissertation and better define the research question. It’s only in the past year, after much thought and exploration, that I’ve begun to gain a clearer sense of direction for my dissertation. Ultimately, my goal is to explore ways to give greater emphasis to topics that benefit urban society as a whole, such as urban nature, culture and knowledge, rather than focussing predominantely on monetary considerations in urban development.

When I started my Bachelor’s degree in [Renewable Resources and Bioenergy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en) at the [University of Hohenheim](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en), I was very focussed on numbers and facts. My studies in natural sciences — biology, chemistry and the like — reinforced this view. I believed that data and calculations were the most reliable ways to understand and discuss the world's questions. This belief was strengthened during my time as a student assistant at the [Life-Cycle Engineering Department GaBi](https://www.iabp.uni-stuttgart.de/gabi/) at the [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/), where I could take a glimpse into Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) models. These models were complex and detailed, and I found them fascinating.

However, as I worked more with LCAs, I started noticing some things that didn’t make much sense to me. For example, one [LCA study suggested that single-use plastic bags might have a lower environmental impact per use than reusable cotton bags](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/grocery-bag-environmental-impact) in certain LCA impact categories[^a]. The study indicated that a reusable cotton bag would need to be used thousands of times to offset its higher impact in certain LCA categories. While the results are likely valid within the study's parameters, the implications that may be drawn from them seemed counterintuitive, given the well-documented environmental issues associated with plastic pollution and its harmful effects on ecosystems globally. Just think about the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_garbage_patch). Similarly, some LCAs comparing organic and conventional farming indicate that organic agriculture, despite its environmental and social benefits, may require more land and resources due to lower yields, leading to less favourable LCA outcomes and overall 'sustainability' scoring[^c]. These findings just didn’t make much sense to me, especially considering my experience working on a Demeter-certified organic farm. I felt that something was missing.

A key moment in my journey was during my stay abroad in Clermont-Ferrand, France, where I studied in the class *['Ingéniérie de Dévéloppement Territorial'](https://www.vetagro-sup.fr/formations/ingenieur-agronome/deroulement-des-etudes/)*. This experience involved working closely with towns and cities, using methods like expert interviews and group discussions,SWOT Analysis and scenario planning. While I did not fully appreciate it at the time, this was my first real exposure to qualitative research. It started to open my eyes to the value of approaches that go beyond numbers.

When I returned to Germany to start my [Master’s in Bioeconomy](https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en/organisation/programme/course/m-bioeconomy) at Hohenheim, I also worked as a student assistant at the [Chair of Environmental Management](hhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140802085139/https://umho.uni-hohenheim.de/). This was when I began to see how different methods — both qualitative and quantitative — could be used together and blend in with economics. I took more courses in social science research, and my interest in these methods steadily grew.

The real change in my thinking came when I joined [Fraunhofer IAO](https://www.iao.fraunhofer.de/lang-en) to work on the [UNaLab Project](https://unalab.eu/) (Urban Nature Labs, H2020 EU project on Nature-Based Solutions). For my Master’s thesis on ["The Governance of Nature-Based Solutions"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3JRqgkWuD8HYwW8yis7Ijm3_PYSOx-e/view?usp=drive_link), I used qualitative methods like expert interviews and grounded theory. This experience was eye-opening for me. I began to understand how these methods could reveal insights that numbers alone couldn’t provide. I was very pleased to receive a top grade for my thesis, which encouraged me to continue exploring this approach.

After completing my Master’s, I joined the [Chair of Societal Transition and Agriculture](https://sta.uni-hohenheim.de/en/) at Hohenheim, where I attended a weekly PhD colloquium. Listening to other students discuss their research, I learned more about the different contexts in which qualitative methods could be used. This deepened my appreciation for these approaches. I also took part in our Chair's journal club and started teaching seminars to Bachelor’s students, where I shared what I had learned.

Again another turning point for me was attending the [ALTER-Net Summer School](https://www.alter-net.info/summer-school/). There, I saw a clear divide between those researchers who relied on quantitative data and those who used qualitative methods. It made me realise that while numbers are often easier to grasp, qualitative research offers a depth of understanding that is just as important, even if it is sometimes harder to apply to broader contexts.

Over time, I have come to understand that both qualitative and quantitative methods have their own strengths and limitations. The challenge, I believe, lies in finding ways to use them together effectively.

Looking back, I see how much my thinking has changed. I started out doubting the value of qualitative research, but now I recognise it as essential for understanding complex issues. My experiences have led me to a research question that I care deeply about: How can we ensure that crucial topics like culture, nature, and knowledge are not overlooked but are given the recognition they deserve?

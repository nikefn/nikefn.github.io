## Nature-Based Solutions - Project URBREATH

![URBREATH Kickoff Meeting Niklas](/assets/images/URBREATH_consortium.jpg)"URBREATH Kickoff Meeting Leuven January 2024"{: class="bigger-image" }

Synopsis: The [URBREATH][1] project aims to improve the climate neutrality of European cities and regions by integrating technical and nature-based solutions with a focus on community participation. It seeks to enhance urban resilience, social inclusion, and liveability through a structured approach that incorporates the development, implementation, and validation of these solutions.

Within this framework, Fraunhofer leads Work Package 7 (WP7), focusing on knowledge transfer, capacity building, and financial sustainability. Our task is to disseminate the knowledge gained throughout the project to partners and cities, providing them with tools and frameworks for implementing and financing NBS. This involves reviewing project data, identifying best practices, and organizing educational activities etc.

A key component of our work is the so called "Training Mission", where we aim to facilitate learning between cities. This includes on-site visits, thematic webinars, and the development of a certification program for Nature-Based Solutions Managers, designed to broaden understanding and application of NBS across Europe.

Please see the presentation I held on our Work Package during the project kickoff beginning 2024:

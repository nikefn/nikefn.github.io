## Nachhaltigkeitstag Uni Hohenheim - A Take on Food Waste and Michelin Star Cooking

Reflecting back in time and specifically on the years 2015 to 2017 brings me back to a project close to my heart: the 'Nachhaltigkeitstag' (lit. translation *Sustainability Day*) at the University of Hohenheim.

The University of Hohenheim resides in an castle built during the 17th century which was transformed into an agricultural academy after food shortages due to [The Year Without a Summer 1816](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer).


Inside the castle, several university chairs and the university administration are located, among those also [the Chair of Societal Transition and Agriculture](https://sta.uni-hohenheim.de/en) where I had the privilege of working for three years.

But thatâ€™s not it, the castle also houses a Michelin-Starred Restaurant called [Speisemeisterei](https://www.speisemeisterei.de/).



Together with the Chefs de Cuisine [Markus Eberhardinger](https://www.slowfood.de/was-wir-tun/projekte-aktionen-und-kampagnen/chef-alliance/koeche_in_deutschland/baden-wuerttemberg/markus-eberhardinger ) (now having his own Slow-Food coutryside restaurant) and [Frank Oehler](https://www.frank-oehler.com/) (celebrity TV Chef in Germany) some friends and colleagues from university and I teamed up to organise this nice event for three consecutive years.

Francesco Armillota, the greengrocer of the restaurant helped us to obtain the ingredients: Vegetables that supermarkets had rejected for their appearance but which were still perfectly edible. Just one day collecting those at the wholesale market in Stuttgart yielded enough produce to feed approx. 300 guests. Crazy!

While the Michelin-starred chefs supervised the cooking and seasoning noumerous helping hands facilitated the cooking itself. See the pictures.







What an honour: We were awarded with a sustainability award by the Environmental Minister. Fun fact: During the panel I was so nervous to talk in front of so many people that my answers to the questions I was asked did not really make sense - at least it was fun for my friends in the audience.
